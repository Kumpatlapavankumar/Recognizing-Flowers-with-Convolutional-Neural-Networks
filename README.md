# ðŸŒ¸ Flower Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project focuses on classifying different types of flowers using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to recognize and classify images of flowers into 5 categories: Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip. This deep learning model is trained on the [Flowers Recognition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition) and uses data augmentation techniques to improve performance.
