The project automatically downloads the flower dataset into the dataset/flower_photos directory.

After the dataset is downloaded, create a new folder named Testing inside the dataset directory:
dataset/flower_photos/Testing/

Add any flower images you want to classify into the Testing folder.

Run the project â€” it will use the trained CNN model to automatically detect and classify the flowers in the Testing folder.
